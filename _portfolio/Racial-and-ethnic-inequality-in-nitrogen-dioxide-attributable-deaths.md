<img src='/images/disparities.PNG'>

This bivariate maps shows the racial and ethnic inequalities in nitrogen dixoide attributable deaths per 100,000, within the Bay area of California. Racial and ethnic minority counts per Census Block Group (CBG) were obtained from the 2010 Census. The nitrogen dioxide attributable deaths per 100,000 was calculated using a health impact function incorporating nitrogen dioxide concentrations from a land use regression, baseline mortality rates from the CDC Wonder database, and a concentration response function for the relationship between death and nitrogen dioxide exposure dervied from the epidemiological literature. The map was created in R using the ggplot package. Code available at: XXX.
