This is a short presentation on our work to estimate the health impacts of air pollution using satellite-derived air pollutant concentration estimates. This presentation was originally developed as part of the 2019 AGU and NASA Data Visualization and Storytelling Competition, presented at the 2019 AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA. Here, I developed it into a short video presentation.
